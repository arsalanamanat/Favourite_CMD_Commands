--help Command :

Command is your manual and is very useful when you need to figure out what a command does. 
For example, if you didn’t know what the command rmdir does, you could use the man command
to find that out.



Clear :

This command is used to clear all previous commands and output from consoles and terminal
windows. This keeps your terminal clean and removes the clutter so you can focus on 
subsequent commands and their output.

Less: 

The less command allows you to view files without opening an editor. It’s faster to use,
and there’s no chance of you inadvertently modifying the file.
